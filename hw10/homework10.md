# Homework 10: tracking

In this homework KCF and CSRT trackers are compared on a moving car video for 20 frames. 

The box is chosen manually once and is used for both trackers for consistency.

The results are saved in the .png files.

In this case I did not observe any differences on how the trackers perform (might try more videos later)
